# Getting Started With Docker
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Secure And Portable Linux Containers Made Easy*

## Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An operating system (e.g. GNU/Linux, Windows) is what makes a computer 
usable. These collections of stacked programs provide the *core 
functionality* that applications, from databases (keeping information) 
to graphics editors (drawing), depend and build upon - on an 
*everything-shared* environment.

[**Docker**](http://www.docker.io) leverages some key OS features (e.g. 
Linux Containers - LXC). It allows you to create folders ***containing*** 
all core dependencies for an application to run on. Each container (and 
process) is kept isolated from any other, and nothing gets shared. 
Unlike virtual machines, they can work together on a single system - 
*all at the same time*.

Docker Highlights:

 - **Containers provide sand-boxing:**  
   Applications run securely - without outside access.
 - **Docker allows simple portability:**  
   Containers are folders, they can be zipped and carried over.
 - **It all works _too_ fast:**  
   Starting a container is as fast as running a single process.
 - **Docker is easy on the system resources (unlike VMs):**  
   Does not need more than what a single application requires.
 - **Agnostic in its _essence_:**  
   Free of framework, language or platform dependencies. 

And most importantly, Docker:

 - **Extracts and removes all complexities:**  
   `docker` accepts commands *in plain English*.

### About This Guide
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this Docker Getting Started manual, we would like to take you on a 
tour, show you what makes this new technology so amazing and get you 
started.

On the [**first page**](1_understanding_docker.md), which is 
**_informative_**:

 - You will find information on our open-source product;
 - And discover Docker's astonishing features.
 - We will also compare it against virtual machines;
 - And see some common use cases.

> [Click here to go to Page 1](1_understanding_docker.md).

The [**second page**](2_technology.md) has some **_technical_** 
information on:

 - Docker's forming parts;
 - The underlying technology, and;
 - *How* they all work.

> [Click here to go to Page 2](2_technology.md).

On the [**third page**](3_dockerfile.md) we get **_practical_**.
There you can:

 - Learn about Docker's elements (i.e. Containers, Images and the 
 Dockerfile);
 - And get started working with them straight away.

> [Click here to go to Page 3](3_dockerfile.md).
 
Finally, on the [**fourth**](4_installation.md) page, we go
**_hands on_** and see:

 - The installation instructions, and;
 - How to make some hard challenges become easy - *using Docker*.

> [Click here to go to Page 4](4_installation.md).

**Note**: We know how valuable time is. Therefore, the documentation is 
prepared in a way to allow anyone to start from any section they wish 
(or need). Although we strongly recommend that you visit [Page 1](1_understanding_docker.md) 
to see how Docker differs, if you already have knowledge on LXC and want 
to quickly find out how Docker revolutionises the technology, don't 
hesitate jumping to [Page 3](3_dockerfile.md.md).
