# About Docker

*Secure And Portable Containers Made Easy*

## Introduction

Operating systems, like Linux or Windows, are what makes a computer
usable. These collections of programs provide the *core functionality*
that applications, from databases to graphics editors, depend and build
upon on an *everything-shared* environment.

[**Docker**](http://www.docker.io) leverages some key operating system
features like process management and networking. It allows you to create
containers holding all the core dependencies for an application to run
on. Each container is kept isolated from any other, and
nothing gets shared.

## Docker highlights

 - **Containers provide sand-boxing:**  
   Applications run securely without outside access.
 - **Docker allows simple portability:**  
   Containers are directories, they can be zipped and transported.
 - **It all works fast:**  
   Starting a container is a very fast single process.
 - **Docker is easy on the system resources (unlike VMs):**  
   No more than what each application needs.
 - **Agnostic in its _essence_:**  
   Free of framework, language or platform dependencies.

And most importantly:

 - **Docker reduces complexity:**  
   Docker accepts commands *in plain English*, e.g. `docker run [..]`.

## About this guide

In this introduction we will take you on a tour. Let us show you what
makes Docker so amazing and help you to *get started*.

On the [**first page**](understanding-docker.md), which is **_informative_**:

 - You will find information on Docker;
 - And discover Docker's features.
 - We will also compare Docker to virtual machines;
 - And see some common use cases.

> [Click here to go to Page 1: Understanding Docker](understanding-docker.md).

The [**second page**](technology.md) has **_technical_** information on:

 - The architecture of Docker;
 - The underlying technology, and;
 - *How* Docker works.

> [Click here to go to Page 2: Understanding the Technology](technology.md).

On the [**third page**](working-with-docker.md) we get **_practical_**. There you can:

 - Learn about Docker's components (i.e. Containers, Images and the Dockerfile);
 - And get started working with them straight away.

> [Click here to go to Page 3: Docker and the Dockerfile](working-with-docker.md).

Finally, on the [**fourth**](get-docker.md) page, we go **_hands on_** and
see:

 - The installation instructions, and;
 - How Docker makes some hard problems much, much easier.

> [Click here to go to Page 4: Installation](get-docker.md).

**Note**: We know how valuable your time is. Therefore, the
documentation is prepared in a way to allow anyone to start from any
section need.  Although we strongly recommend that you visit [Page
1](understanding-docker.md) to see how Docker is different, if you
already have some knowledge and want to quickly get started with Docker,
don't hesitate to jump to [Page 3](working-with-docker.md).
