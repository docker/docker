# Getting Docker

*How to install Docker?*

## Introductions

Once you are comfortable with your level of knowledge on Docker, and 
feel like actually trying the product, you can download and start using 
it by following the links listed below. There, you will find instructions, 
specifically tailored for your platform of choice. 

Docker is a flexible tool and offers a unified experience across 
different systems. In order to achieve this, it adapts itself and works 
specifically to make the most out of all available features and tools 
provided by the underlying operating-system on the computer it resides.
