# About Docker

*Secure And Portable Linux Containers Made Easy*

## Introduction

An *operating system* (OS), e.g. GNU/Linux or Windows, is what makes a computer
usable. These collections of stacked programs provide the *core functionality*
that applications, from databases (keeping information) to graphics editors
(drawing), depend and build upon on an *everything-shared* environment.

[**Docker**](http://www.docker.io) leverages some key OS features (e.g. Linux 
Containers). It allows you to create folders **_containing_** all core 
dependencies for an application to run on. Each container (thus process) is 
kept isolated from any other, and nothing gets shared. Unlike virtual machines,
they can work together on a single system **_all at the same time_**.

## Docker highlights

 - **Containers provide sand-boxing:**  
   Applications run securely without outside access.
 - **Docker allows simple portability:**  
   Containers are directories, they can be zipped and carried over.
 - **It all works _too_ fast:**  
   Starting a container is as fast as running a single process.
 - **Docker is easy on the system resources (unlike VMs):**  
   No more than what a single application would need.
 - **Agnostic in its _essence_:**  
   Free of framework, language or platform dependencies. 

And most importantly:

 - **Docker extracts and removes all complexities:**  
   Docker accepts commands *in plain English*, e.g. `docker run [..]`.

## About this guide

In this introduction section of Docker documentation, we would like to take you
on a tour. Let us show you what makes this new technology so amazing and help
you to *get started*.

On the [**first page**](introduction/understanding-docker.md), which is **_informative_**:

 - You will find information on our open-source product;
 - And discover Docker's astonishing features.
 - We will also compare it against virtual machines;
 - And see some common use cases.

> [Click here to go to Page 1: Understanding Docker](introduction/understanding-docker.md).

The [**second page**](introduction/technology.md) has some **_technical_** information on:

 - Docker's forming parts;
 - The underlying technology, and;
 - *How* they all work.

> [Click here to go to Page 2: Understanding the Technology](introduction/technology.md).

On the [**third page**](introduction/working-with-docker.md) we get **_practical_**. There you can:

 - Learn about Docker's elements (i.e. Containers, Images and the 
 Dockerfile);
 - And get started working with them straight away.

> [Click here to go to Page 3: Docker and the Dockerfile](introduction/working-with-docker.md).
 
Finally, on the [**fourth**](introduction/get-docker.md) page, we go **_hands on_** and
see:

 - The installation instructions, and;
 - How to make some hard challenges become easy - *using Docker*.

> [Click here to go to Page 4: Installation](introduction/get-docker.md).

**Note**: We know how valuable time is. Therefore, the documentation is 
prepared in a way to allow anyone to start from any section they wish, or need.
Although we strongly recommend that you visit [Page 1](introduction/understanding-docker.md)
to see how Docker is different, if you already have some knowledge and want to
quickly find out how Docker revolutionises the technology, don't hesitate
jumping to [Page 3](introduction/working-with-docker.md).
