# Vagrant-docker

This is a placeholder for the official vagrant-docker, a plugin for Vagrant (http://vagrantup.com) which exposes Docker as a provider.


## Contributing

There are several parallel efforts to implement a vagrant provider. To contribute to the effort, please follow these steps:

* Fork the docker repository (and star it while you're at it :)

* Checkout the origin/vagrant-provider branch.

* Make a pull request from your local banch to origin/vagrant-provider
