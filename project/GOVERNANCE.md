# Docker Governance Advisory Board Meetings

In the spirit of openness, Docker created a Governance Advisory Board, and committed to make all materials and notes from the meetings of this group public.
All output from the meetings should be considered proposals only, and are subject to the review and approval of the community and the project leadership.
